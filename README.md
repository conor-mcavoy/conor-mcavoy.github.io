## Welcome
I plan for this site to eventually be a sort of blog, but we'll see what happens.

## About Me
My name is Conor McAvoy. I like math, programming, books, and my cat Lily. I currently work for Salesforce as a software engineer, and I live in San Francisco.

## Talks
* I gave a talk on Sep 7th, 2022 titled "Interactive Observability Analytics with Trino at Scale" at the [2022 AWS Open Source Symposium](https://awsopensourcesymposium2022.splashthat.com/). The recording is available [here](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-event-T3-open-source-symposium-2022-reg-event.html) but requires registration.
